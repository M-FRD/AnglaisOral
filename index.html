        <p class="Mael">Hello to both of you.</p>
        <p class="Evan">Good morning.</p>
        <p class="Max">Hello.</p>
        <p class="Mael">We are going to debate on the subject of video games, I will start by asking you a question. Are video games a waste of time for you?</p>
        <p class="Evan">In my opinion, video games are clearly a waste of time, indeed, these games are useless, brainless, and make people stupid and violent.</p>
        <p class="Mael">Wow! I mean, Mael what do you think of what evan said? Is it a stereotype in your opinion?</p>
        <p class="Max">I agree with you up to a point. From my point of view, some video games can make some people violent, especially children, which is why some games have an age limit. Howover, from my point of view, video games improve players' literacy through regular reading of instructions, game history and blogs, but also their thinking and creativity through some games.</p>
        <p class="Evan">When you say video games can improve thinking, do you mean some games make you more intelligent?</p>
        <p class="Max">Not really, what I mean is games, especially strategy games, force you to think about complex things and look for solutions for a long time and all the time, which is obviously very useful, especially in studies, when you have to solve a problem.</p>
        <p class="Mael">Okay, I understand what you're saying, but in spite of these positive points, does spending a lot of time in front of video games have a negative impact on the players?</p>
        <p class="Evan">I think that yes, spending a lot of time playing video games can not only damage your eyes, but also prevent you from making social bonds because you go out less. Thus, this can easily impact the mental well-being of the player and destroy them from the inside.</p>
